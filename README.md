## 🪪 Credits

Zappmint is built on top of [Llamacoder](https://github.com/Nutlope/llamacoder) — an open-source AI coding agent developed by [@Nutlope](https://github.com/Nutlope).  
Huge thanks to the contributors of Llamacoder for laying the foundation of AI-assisted code generation.

## ✨ What is Zappmint?

**Zappmint** lets anyone turn a simple text prompt into a fully functional **mini app (Zapp)** — and automatically mints a token with it.  
It’s designed to help creators, builders, and meme projects quickly:

- 🛠 Validate ideas
- 🌱 Build community
- 💰 Launch tokenized utilities

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- 🧠 **Type a prompt** – Describe your app idea in plain English
- 🤖 **AI generates Zapp** – Code, logic, and contracts created instantly
- 🪙 **Deploy & mint** – App goes onchain with its own token

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – Frontend framework
- **[Llamacoder](https://github.com/Nutlope/llamacoder)** – Open-source AI coding engine
- **Together.ai** – Inference layer for LLM-based code generation
